    <h2>1. Purchase of Tickets</h2>
    <p>
      Tickets are supplied electronically in the form of a Booking Code which
      must be shown at the Box Office or entrance to gain entry to the theatre.
      Your Booking Code is emailed to you when you purchase a ticket, and can
      also be seen on your "My Account" page
    </p>
    <p>
      All tickets are for General Admission and specific seats may not be
      reserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tickets purchased online are subject to a booking fee. Check the total
      amount before proceeding to the payment pages. Some shows also include a
      Theatre Improvement Levy which provides a valuable source of funding to
      theatre maintenance and improvements at Bristol SU.
    </p>

      component services.
    </p>
    <h2>3. Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We cannot exchange, refund, transfer or return tickets unless the event in
      question is cancelled or details of the event are significantly changed
      (for example, show time, venue, date etc).
    </p>
    <p>
      On occasions where an event is officially cancelled we'll contact you via
      the email address you gave us when registering. We'll then offer you the
      choice of a refund or, where available, tickets to the rescheduled event.
    </p>

      such a situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right of admission to any non-Bristol Students' Union venue is at the
      discretion of the venue manager there.
    </p>
