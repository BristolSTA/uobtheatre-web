# Normal-person's guide to installing and running frontend locally
If your idea of what a yarn is is something that cats play with, you're probably in the right place. Here's some fairly comprehensive instructions on how to install this and make it do stuff.

## Install vscode
There are many options of text editor/IDE that you can use to write and read code, but all are categorically worse than vs-code. Go download and install it from (https://code.visualstudio.com/)[https://code.visualstudio.com/] - the install you need depends on your operating system (mac/windows/other), but I'm sure you can figure that out. Leave the settings in the installer as default.

## Install Github desktop
We use github to store and transmit our code across the internet between people. It's major benefit is that it keeps everything organised, and means that it's much more difficult (although not impossible) to lose code. It has fancy command liney stuff, but if you're here, you probably don't want that. Github make a desktop client that makes this easy, GUI and pretty. You can download it from (https://desktop.github.com/)[https://desktop.github.com/] - leave the install settings as default

## Install nodejs
``nodejs`` 
## Install yarn
``yarn`` is a package manager - it's effectively a library of different modules ("packages") that other people have written that do cool (or really dull) things. It makes our code more readable, and reduces the amount of stuff that we actually have to maintain. 

## Clone the repository
"Clone the repository" is fancy words for downloading the code to your computer. In the github desktop client, click *add*, *clone repository* and select the repository you need from the *Github.com* list
Now, the code should be downloaded, and put in your *Documents/GitHub/uobtheatre* (or similar) folder.

## Open the repository in vscode
Go to the folder containing the repository on your computer (likely *Documents/GitHub/uobtheatre* or similar), *right click* and select *Open with Code*. That will open the folder as a vscode project.
